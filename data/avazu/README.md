# Avazu_x4

+ **Dataset description:**

  This dataset contains about 10 days of labeled click-through data on mobile advertisements. It has 22 feature fields including user features and advertisement attributes. Following the same setting with the [AutoInt](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11921) work, we split the data randomly into 8:1:1 as the training set, validation set, and test set, respectively. 

  The dataset statistics are summarized as follows:

  | Dataset  | Total | #Train | #Validation | #Test | 
  | :--------: | :-----: |:-----: | :----------: | :----: | 
  | Avazu_x4 |  40,428,967     |  32,343,172   |  4,042,897     | 4,042,898     |  


  - Avazu_x4_001

    In this setting, we preprocess the data split by removing the ``id`` field that is useless for CTR prediction. In addition, we transform the timestamp field into three fields: hour, weekday, and is_weekend. For all categorical fields, we filter infrequent features by setting the threshold min_category_count=2 (performs well) and replace them with a default ``<OOV>`` token. Note that we do not follow the exact preprocessing steps in AutoInt, because the authors neither remove the useless ``id`` field nor specially preprocess the timestamp field. We fix **embedding_dim=16** following the existing [AutoInt work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11921).

    In this setting, we preprocess the data split by removing the ``id`` field that is useless for CTR prediction. In addition, we transform the timestamp field into three fields: hour, weekday, and is_weekend. For all categorical fields, we filter infrequent features by setting the threshold min_category_count=1 and replace them with a default ``<OOV>`` token. Note that we found that min_category_count=1 performs the best, which is surprising. We fix **embedding_dim=40** following the existing [FGCNN work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04447).
